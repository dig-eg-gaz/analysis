>The goal of my post is to answer questions such as the reasons behind the spread of the Bubonic Plague across Egypt, what cities were the most affected and why, and what actions were taken to cease it. In doing so I will integrate charts and graphs of where and when occurrences were the most often. This information was gathered conducting an Xpath query on the Egyptian Gazette between the years 1904-1907. The following query will be used to search for words such as "plague", "bubonic", and "bubonic plague". The following Xpath query was included
//div[@type="page"][@n="3" or @n="4" or @n="5"]/div[not(@type="advert") or (@type="advertisement")]/p
